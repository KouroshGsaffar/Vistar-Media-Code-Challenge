# Guess The Number

At Vistar, we like to play "Guess the Number" in our downtime. One of our
engineers hacked together our current version using raw jQuery. We're
trying to modernize with some new technology, and we think React.js
would do the trick.

Some improvements we'd like for the new version:

* Replace jQuery with React
* Separate code and markup
* Break up UI into modular components
* Test the components

Our current version looks plain. You may want to spruce it up,
but we won't dock you if you don't.

## Notes

Feel free to take whatever liberties with the implementation you like. No need
to go overboard - if you spend more than two hours on it, maybe take a step
back.

Please complete your solution using [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io)
using the "React" template. You will be able to share your solution via a unique
link once you save it.

We kindly request that you do not post your solution to any public website or
source repository.
